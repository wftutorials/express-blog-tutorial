# Express Tutorial	

This is a small blog application created using express.js framework. I created it to learn about the framework. The blog allows you to view recent posts. You can navigate to other pages and login and logout. You can also create a new post.

You can learn more about express here - https://expressjs.com/.

The walkthrough guide for this repo can be found here - https://wftutorials.wordpress.com/
